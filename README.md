Trader Behavior Insights â€“ Bitcoin Market Sentiment Analysis   (((((README prepared with the assistance of AI-based tools for clarity and formatting)))))))))))))))) ->For Transparency
Overview
This project analyzes the relationship between market sentiment (Fear/Greed Index) and trader performance using:

Bitcoin Market Sentiment Dataset

Historical Trader Data from Hyperliquid

The objective is to uncover patterns in trader behavior under different sentiment conditions and provide data-driven recommendations for trading strategies.

Objectives
Explore correlations between market sentiment and PnL.

Apply statistical tests (ANOVA, correlation analysis) to validate relationships.

Identify trader behavior patterns during Fear vs Greed market phases.

Provide actionable insights for improving trading outcomes.

Key Findings
Market trends influenced PnL more strongly than sentiment alone.

Extreme sentiment (both Fear and Greed) coincided with higher volatility, leading to greater profit and loss swings.

A subset of traders performed consistently well regardless of sentiment, suggesting robust strategies.

Technologies Used
Python: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy, statsmodels

Jupyter Notebook for analysis and visualization

Results Summary
PnL differences between Fear and Greed periods were statistically significant.

Sentiment alone was not enough to predict outcomes; combining it with price trends improved accuracy.

Recommended multi-factor trading strategies that incorporate sentiment, price momentum, and leverage analysis.
